# Si535x Delta Only Register Script
# 
# This script can be written to a device to reconfigure it. YOU MUST HAVE 
# PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN ONE OF THE FULL CONFIGURATION SCRIPTS. For example, if at
# device reset your system writes P3-Registers-Script.txt to fully reconfigure
# the device, it can then write any of P*-Delta-Only-Registers-Script.txt to 
# switch to new configuration. These "delta only" scripts contain only the 
# registers that changed between configurations, skipping don't cares. The 
# script also includes any configure pre-amble and post-amble register control
# sequence that the device requires.
